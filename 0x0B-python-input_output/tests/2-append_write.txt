The append_write function from 2-append_write module
===================================================

Using append_write
------------------

Append the following content to a file named `file_append.txt`:

    This School is so cool!

If the file doesn't exist, it should be created. If it already exists, the text should be appended to the end of the file.

Example:

    >>> append_write = __import__('2-append_write').append_write
    >>> nb_characters_added = append_write("file_append.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
    >>> nb_characters_added
    24

Check the content of `file_append.txt`. It should now contain two lines with the appended text:

    >>> with open("file_append.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    ...     content = file.read()
    >>> content
    'This School is so cool!\nThis School is so cool!\n'
