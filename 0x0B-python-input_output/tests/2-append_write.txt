The append_write function from 2-append_write module
====================================================

Using append_write
------------------

Create or append to a file named `file_append.txt` with the following content:

    This School is so cool!

To test the function, run the script directly. Ensure that the `file_append.txt` file is in the same directory as `2-append_write.py`.

Example:

    >>> append_write = __import__('2-append_write').append_write
    >>> nb_characters_added = append_write("file_append.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
    >>> nb_characters_added
    24

Check the content of `file_append.txt`:

    >>> with open("file_append.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    ...     content = file.read()
    >>> content
    'This School is so cool!\nThis School is so cool!\n'
