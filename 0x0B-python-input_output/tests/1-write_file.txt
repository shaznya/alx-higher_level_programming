The write_file function from 1-write_file module
===============================================

Using write_file
----------------

Create or overwrite a file named `my_first_file.txt` with the following content:

    This School is so cool!

To test the function, run the script directly. Ensure that the `my_first_file.txt` file is in the same directory as `1-write_file.py`.

Example:

    >>> write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file
    >>> nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
    >>> nb_characters
    24

Check the content of `my_first_file.txt`:

    >>> with open("my_first_file.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    ...     content = file.read()
    >>> content
    'This School is so cool!\n'
